          Our Story
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          Founded in 2024, Indian Spice was born out of a deep passion for Indian food and the desire to share the beauty of 
          Indian cuisine with the world. Our founder, Anjali yadav, grew up where food was the heart of every gathering. 
          Inspired by family recipes passed down through generations, Anjali yadav decided to bring these authentic flavors to Uttar Pradesh, 
          offering a warm and inviting space where guests can experience the true taste of India.

          that have been perfected over centuries. We bring together regional specialties from all over India, including North India, South India, 
          and everything in between.
